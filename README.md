# OPLA Site
OPLA is a sample site for an EOC organized into standard Sections: Operations, Planning, Logistics, Admin (OPLA). It also is intended as our first, initial demonstration of our concept. 

Rather than read pages of web design & architecture, just set up a copy of this site on the cloud or on your laptop and see what the current (future for now) expericnce is. 

#Feedback
PLEASE do provide your feedback, using the "Issues" tab above, so we know how to make the best system possible! Please also provide your insights on the Issues marked RFC: "Request For Comments"

In the future this repository should provide documentation and necessary tools so you can create your own OPLA organized website serving your EOC staff and volunteers.
Until we've had time to provide more guidance, you can set up a minimal DNN website on your Windows laptop in minutes using NVQuickSite:
https://github.com/nvisionative/nvQuickSite/wiki. Soon we plan on having a cloud based Docker or Azure container as a easy alternative.
